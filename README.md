# portfolio

## Description
This project is a webpage showcasing my portfolio of projects. It is designed in a way that I can continuously update it with projects I make in the future. It's not the most aesthetically pleasing website in the world :) but it is functional and I plan on tweaking the design as time goes on to make it more pleasing to the eye, as my CSS skills continue to develop.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This project is designed for future potential employers, or of course those who are curious, to view my portfolio. The layout is designed to be easy to navigate, and I used a combination of flex and grid to get the result in the screenshot below.
